# Pipelines

WebSphere Hybrid Edition uses [pipelines](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/master/docs#usage) to illustrate a continuous input and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow. This repository provides a set of default tasks and pipelines that can be associated with application stacks. These pipelines validate the application stack is active, build the application stack, publish the image to a container registry, scan the published image, and then deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster. You can also create your own tasks and pipelines and customize the pre-built pipelines and tasks.
